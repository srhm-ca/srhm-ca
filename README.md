I’m [Sil](https://srhm.ca/). I work with language models. I have papers at [ACL](https://aclanthology.org/2023.wnu-1.15/), [COLING](https://aclanthology.org/2022.latechclfl-1.11/), and [AAAI](https://creativeai-ws.github.io/#accepted). My work has been discussed by [NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/chatgpt-can-generate-essay-generate-rcna60362), [The Financial Times](sil@srhm.ca), and [Le Devoir](https://www.ledevoir.com/culture/medias/774857/intelligence-artificielle-quelle-objectivite). 

I’m looking to collaborate! Talk to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/srhm_ca), over [email](sil@srhm.ca), and through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/srhm). I’m also on [Libera](https://libera.chat/) and [OFTC](https://oftc.net/) as `srhm`. 

I consult! My CV is [here](https://srhm.ca/Hamilton_CV_Public.pdf). You can find my code on [SourceHut](https://git.sr.ht/~srhm/) (preferred) and here.
